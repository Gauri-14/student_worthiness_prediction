#  Student Creditworthiness Prediction

This is a simple Data Science project to predict whether a student is **creditworthy or not** based on academic and socio-economic factors. 

##  Problem Statement

Many fintech platforms aim to offer credit to students, but identifying **trustworthy and responsible students** is challenging. This project attempts to solve this by using a machine learning model trained on student data.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following features:
- Academic Performance (e.g., CGPA)
- Attendance
- Family Income
- Number of Backlogs
- Extra Curricular Activities
- Loan History
- Target: Creditworthy (Yes/No)

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Google Colab
- GitHub

##  ML Model Used

- Logistic Regression
- Accuracy: ~90%
- Evaluated using confusion matrix, classification report

##  How to Use

1. Open the notebook:  
   [View in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Gauri-14/student_worthiness_prediction/blob/main/student_creditworthiness.ipynb)

2. Run all cells in order  
3. Modify the inputs or try other ML models!

##  Output

The model predicts whether a student is **creditworthy = Yes/No** based on inputs.
